## ðŸ“– About the project
Project developed as part of a code/project challenge at DIO, as part of the BootCamp: "PotÃªncia Tech iFood - Game Development." The project is based on the logic of the memory game, meaning its algorithm is grounded in sorting and shuffling, along with various other interactivities that provide a good user experience. Not only that, but the game also features two modes: the free and timeless mode, and the timed mode, which includes a 2-minute countdown timer.
